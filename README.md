# Pi Approximation Lab
An educational Java tool offering various algorithms to approximate π, ideal for learning programming and basic mathematical concepts.

## Overview
This Java application is an educational tool for approximating the value of π (pi). It provides implementations of the Gregory-Leibniz series, Nilakantha series, and a limit-based approach to calculate pi to varying degrees of accuracy. The project serves as an exercise in basic programming concepts, the modulo operation, and simple mathematical algorithms.

## Features
- **Even/Odd Checking**: Functions to determine if an integer is even or odd.
- **Gregory-Leibniz Series**: Approximates pi using the Gregory-Leibniz series algorithm.
- **Nilakantha Series**: Uses the Nilakantha series for a more accurate approximation of pi.
- **Limit-Based Approach**: Offers a limit-based method to calculate pi.
- **User Input**: Accepts the number of iterations and algorithm choice from standard input.

## Usage
To use the application:
1. Run the program.
2. Input the algorithm choice when prompted: `GL` for Gregory-Leibniz, `L` for the limit-based method, or `NL` for Nilakantha.
3. Enter the number of iterations (N value) for the selected method.
4. The program will output the approximation of pi after the specified iterations and compare it with the official value of pi.

## Getting Started
Compile the Java source code and run the `App` class. Ensure Java is properly installed on your system to execute the program.
